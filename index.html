    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My main interests lie in data science and artificial intelligence. I am deeply drawn to the potential of these fields to transform large volumes of data into meaningful insights and to develop systems capable of learning and adapting autonomously. I am committed to exploring these areas to leverage their power in solving complex problems and creating innovative solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
    I see myself as dedicated and creative, with a strong capacity for teamwork and a constant desire to learn. I strive to be meticulous and organized in my work, always taking my responsibilities seriously. Additionally, I am participative and have an analytical approach to the tasks I undertake. I view new challenges as opportunities to grow, and I'm committed to continuously expanding my horizons.
    </p>
    <p>
    As a prospective researcher, I bring a strong foundation in critical thinking and a methodical approach to problem-solving. I excel at designing experiments, analyzing data rigorously, and applying innovative methodologies to uncover insights that drive meaningful outcomes. My passion for research is reflected in my ability to collaborate across disciplines, communicate complex ideas clearly, and remain curious in the face of uncertainty. I am proactive in seeking new knowledge, and I embrace challenges as chances to advance scientific understanding and contribute to cutting-edge advancements in the field.
